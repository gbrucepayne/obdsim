# ELM327 Commands

* `\r` is the line terminator
* Echo may be enabled by default
* `>` may appear as a command prompt
* Repeat `ATZ` until a response contains `ELM327`
* Echo may be disabled with `ATE0`
* Protocol memory should be disabled using `ATM0`
* Linefeed (`\n`) addition following `\r` can be enabled using `ATL1`
* Spacing between bytes should be removed using `ATS0`
* Headers should be enabled using `ATH1` to allow distinction of ECU when
receiving responses.
    * 11-bit CAN uses `7E8` for ECU #1 aka ECM Engine Control Module, and
    `7E9` for ECU #2 TCM Transmission Control Module
    * 29-bit CAN typically uses `18DAF110` for ECM, which on ELM327 will be
    presented something like `nn nn 10`
* Use adaptive timing with `ATAT1`
* (Optional) Disable protocol memory `ATM0`
* Set the auto protocol detection using `ATSPA0`
* When sending initial PID supported request `0100` when auto detection is used,
expect a longer delay with `SEARCHING...` and possibly `UNABLE TO CONNECT`.
* Timeouts can be challenging but are indicated with `NO DATA`. Settings in
`AT ST FF` set the maximum timeout.
* Low power operation is supported by some devices
    * `ACT ALERT` is sent 1 minute before the low power timer expires
    * `LP ALERT` is sent when the timer expires

If automatic protocol detection has been configured e.g. `ATSAP6` for
ISO 15765-4 CAN 11-bit 500 kbaud, the ELM will transmit multiple requests on the
CAN bus.
